Offline/Online Evaluation: Rapid Framework

 I'll explain the offline/online evaluation framework.

Testing context quality only in live environment is risky. Offline evaluation measures context performance before going to production.

Context Architecture experts establish rapid evaluation framework: Offline benchmark tests, synthetic data validation, historical data replay.

Offline metrics: Context relevance score, semantic similarity, coverage ratio, response quality. Online metrics: User satisfaction, task success rate, engagement.

Rapid feedback loop: Offline test → Online A/B test → Performance monitoring → Iterative improvement.

Result: Context quality is guaranteed pre-production, risk is minimized, development speed increases.

With the Context Architecture profession, context testing processes run with scientific method.
