"Context Window Economy": Reducing Token Waste

 I'll explain how to reduce token waste with "Context window economy".

In LLMs, every token costs money. Sending unnecessary information increases costs and decreases performance. Context Architecture provides both cost and quality advantages by optimizing token usage.

Context Architecture experts develop smart token management strategies: Information filtering based on importance scores, repetitive content elimination, dynamic context window sizing.

Token optimization techniques: Shortening long texts with summarization algorithms, key information extraction, unnecessary metadata cleaning. Every token creates maximum value.

Result: Token cost decreases by 60%, response quality increases, system performance is maximized.

With the Context Architecture profession, LLM usage becomes cost-effective.
