Production Gates with Confidence Scores

 I'll explain production gates with confidence scores.

AI systems are not equally reliable in every situation. Low confidence score decisions shouldn't go to production. Context Architecture protects the system with quality gates.

Context Architecture experts define confidence score metrics: Context quality, model confidence, data consistency, historical performance.

Quality gates: If confidence score is below 90%, human approval; below 70%, automatic rejection; below 50%, system halt.

Result: Erroneous decisions don't reach production environment, system reliability is maximized.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI systems transform into quality control experts.
