Context Graph: Event-Data-Intent Connection Map

 I'll explain how Context Graph works.

Traditional AI systems process data as flat lists. Context Graph creates meaningful connections between events, data, and intents. This enables AI to understand not just information, but relationships.

Context Architecture experts model customer interactions in graph structure. "Customer X asked about product Y" is not just an event, but a node connected to past purchases, current needs, and future intents.

Context Graph gives AI the ability to answer the "why" question. It can understand not just what happened, but why it happened and what will happen.

Result: AI systems make 500% smarter decisions, prediction accuracy is maximized, user experience becomes personalized.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI's memory transforms into graph-based intelligence.
