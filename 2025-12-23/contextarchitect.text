Solution Time with Context Convergence in Support Articles

 I'll explain the context convergence case in support articles.

Technical support team was finding solutions to customer problems in an average of 45 minutes. With context convergence, this time dropped to 12 minutes. How did it happen?

Problem: Support articles contained general information. Customer's specific situation, past solutions, system configuration were not considered.

Context Architecture solution: Context convergence system. Customer profile + problem category + system status + past solutions = personalized article recommendation.

Result: Solution time decreased by 73%, customer satisfaction increased by 90%, support team efficiency maximized.

With the Context Architecture profession, support systems transform into intelligent solution experts.
