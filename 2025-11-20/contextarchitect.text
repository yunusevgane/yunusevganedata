Event-Driven Context Architecture

 I'll explain event-driven context architecture.

Traditional context systems are static. Event-driven context dynamically updates context as events occur. The system becomes smarter with each event.

Context Architecture experts define event triggers: User actions, system state changes, external API responses. Each event triggers a context update.

Event chain management: One event triggers another, context gradually enriches. "Add to cart â†’ Payment page â†’ Shipping selection" context expands at each step.

Result: Context always stays current, user experience becomes proactive, system gains prediction capability.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI systems transform into real-time context experts.
