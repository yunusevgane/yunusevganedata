Practical Way to Create Ontology and Glossary

 I'll explain the practical way to create ontology and glossary.

In complex businesses, the same concepts are expressed in different ways. Do "customer", "client", "user" mean the same thing? Ontology and glossary organize this chaos.

Context Architecture experts create business ontology: Relationships between concepts, synonymous terms, hierarchical structures. Consistent concept usage across all systems.

Practical implementation: Term extraction from existing systems, expert interviews, automatic glossary updates. Living glossary system.

Result: 100% conceptual consistency achieved, system integrations simplified, AI systems work in correct context.

With the Context Architecture profession, business language becomes standardized.
