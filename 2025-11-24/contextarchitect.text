Signal Engineering: From Logs to Meaning Layer

 I'll explain signal engineering.

Raw log data are just technical records. Signal engineering transforms this data into meaningful context layers. It's the art of extracting meaning from logs.

Context Architecture experts analyze log data to find hidden patterns: User behavior signals, system performance indicators, anomaly markers.

Signal enrichment: Adding metadata to raw data, timestamp analysis, user journey mapping. Every log entry transforms into valuable context information.

Result: Log data transforms into strategic intelligence, prediction capability increases, operational efficiency is maximized.

With the Context Architecture profession, data processing happens at the meaning layer.
