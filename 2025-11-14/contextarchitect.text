Prompt Templates vs. Context Templates

 I'll explain the difference between prompt templates and context templates.

Prompt templates are static texts: "You are an expert assistant, answer this question." Context templates are dynamic structures: User state, past interactions, business rules are automatically integrated.

Context Architecture experts design situational context templates. They create specialized context structures for each user type, each scenario, each time period.

Prompt template: "You are a customer service assistant." Context template: "VIP customer + technical issue + 3rd time calling + previous solutions failed + escalation needed" automatic context.

Result: AI responses become 500% more personalized, contextual consistency is achieved, user experience is maximized.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI interactions transform from static templates to dynamic intelligence.
