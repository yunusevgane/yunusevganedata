Canary & Dark Launch: Gradual Context Rollout

 I'll explain Canary and dark launch strategies.

Releasing new context changes to all users simultaneously is risky. Canary deployment ensures gradual rollout of context changes.

Context Architecture experts design gradual rollout strategy: 5% beta users, 20% internal users, 50% selected customers, 100% all users.

Dark launch: New context runs in parallel but results are not shown to users. Performance and accuracy are tested, if no issues, switch to real traffic.

Result: Context changes are rolled out 100% safely, user experience continues uninterrupted, risk is minimized.

With the Context Architecture profession, context rollout becomes a controlled process.
