Synchronizing Business Concepts (Customer/User)

 I'll explain business concept synchronization.

In companies, "customer" and "user" concepts carry different meanings in different systems. Customer in CRM, user in support system, client in billing. Context Architecture eliminates this conceptual chaos.

Context Architecture experts create business concept dictionaries and ensure consistent usage across all systems. A single customer entity has the same contextual meaning across all touchpoints.

Result: 100% data consistency across systems, conceptual confusion eliminated, AI systems work in correct context.

With the Context Architecture profession, business concepts become harmonized across systems.
