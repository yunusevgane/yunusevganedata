Context Trail for Post-Incident Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

 I'll explain context trail for post-incident root cause analysis.

The question "why did it happen?" is critical in system failures. Context trail records the context behind every decision. Indispensable for RCA (Root Cause Analysis).

Context Architecture experts establish comprehensive tracing systems: Context used for each decision, timestamp, source information, processing steps.

Forensic analysis: Which context was the wrong decision made with? Where did that context come from? Who provided it? When was it updated? Complete traceability.

Root cause detection: Context source problems, data quality issues, authorization errors, timeout situations.

Result: RCA time is shortened by 80%, real problem source is found, similar errors are prevented.

With the Context Architecture profession, system error analysis reaches CSI investigation level.
