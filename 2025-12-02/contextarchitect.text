Reducing Errors with Negative Context Examples

 I'll explain the technique of reducing errors with negative context examples.

AI systems don't only learn from "correct" examples. "Wrong" examples also teach. Negative context enables the system to learn what it should not do.

Context Architecture experts create collections of negative examples: Wrong decisions, incorrect interpretations, inappropriate responses. These examples are used to prevent the system from repeating similar mistakes.

Negative context strategy: "In this situation don't say X, say Y", "In this context don't suggest A, suggest B", "Under these conditions don't do C, do D". The system learns both what to do and what not to do.

Result: Error rates decrease by 70%, wrong decisions are minimized, system reliability is maximized.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI systems learn from both positive and negative examples.
