Guardrail Design: Rules, Testing, Telemetry

 I'll explain Guardrail design.

As AI systems become more powerful, control mechanisms become critical. Guardrails are protective systems that ensure AI operates within safe boundaries. Context Architecture designs these protection layers.

Context Architecture experts establish a three-layer guardrail system: Rule layer (what not to do), test layer (validation controls), telemetry layer (continuous monitoring).

Example guardrail: "Financial advice prohibition + Customer personal data sharing prohibition + Company secrets disclosure prohibition" rules are tested in real-time and violations are immediately blocked.

Result: AI systems operate within 100% safe boundaries, risk factors are minimized, compliance is ensured.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI systems achieve safe and controlled operation.
