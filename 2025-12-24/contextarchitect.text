E2E Observability: Context Telemetry Dashboard

 I'll explain E2E observability and context telemetry dashboard.

Seeing what works in context systems is critical. End-to-end observability makes context flow completely transparent.

Context Architecture experts establish comprehensive telemetry systems: Context usage metrics, performance indicators, quality scores, error rates.

Telemetry dashboard: Real-time context health, trend analyses, anomaly detections, performance bottlenecks.

Proactive alerts: Automatic notification when context quality drops, usage becomes abnormal, error threshold is exceeded.

Result: Context systems are completely visible, problems are detected early, optimization opportunities are not missed.

With the Context Architecture profession, context management achieves full transparency.
