ContextOps Workflow: Design-Test-Deploy

 I'll explain the ContextOps workflow.

Traditional DevOps is code-focused. ContextOps is context-focused operation processes: Design, test, deployment stages are all shaped around context quality.

Context Architecture experts manage context lifecycle: Context design → Quality tests → Staging environment validation → Gradual prod rollout → Continuous monitoring.

Context metrics at each stage: Relevance score, freshness index, consistency rate. No progression to next stage unless quality thresholds are met.

Result: Context quality guaranteed, no surprises in prod environment, AI system reliability maximized.

With the Context Architecture profession, context management transforms into professional operation process.
