RAG or Fine-tune? Strategic Decision Framework

 I'll explain the strategic decision framework between RAG and Fine-tune.

"RAG or Fine-tune?" is the wrong question. The right question is: "Which context strategy best fits my business goals?" Context Architecture makes this decision based on data and business requirements.

Context Architecture experts analyze data dynamics, security requirements, cost tolerance, and performance expectations. They recommend fine-tune for static information, RAG for dynamic information, and hybrid approaches for mixed situations.

RAG: Current information, low cost, fast updates. Fine-tune: Deep expertise, high performance, fixed cost. Context Architecture optimizes both.

Result: Technology choice serves business strategy, optimal cost-performance balance is achieved, scalability is ensured.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI technology decisions are grounded on strategic foundation.
