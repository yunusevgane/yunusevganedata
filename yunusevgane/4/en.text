As a Context Architecture expert observing the evolution of AI teams.

AI teams are undergoing a major transformation. Yesterday, Prompt Engineers optimized individual queries. Today, Context Architecture experts manage entire system ecosystems.

While Prompt Engineering perfects single interactions, the Context Architecture profession ensures cross-system harmony. It establishes contextual consistency between different platforms and AI models.

Context Architecture experts design scenarios that deliver the right information to AI models in the right context. They develop automation scenarios organizing systems to act according to context.

Prompt Engineering is now becoming a subset of the Context Architecture profession. Because the future leader of AI teams will be Context Architecture experts who direct strategic context.
