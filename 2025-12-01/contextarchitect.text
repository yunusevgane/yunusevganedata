Time Dimension: Context Freshness Policies

 I'll explain context freshness policies.

The age of information matters. 1-day-old stock prices and 1-year-old prices carry different meanings. Context Architecture puts the time dimension at the center of context management.

Context Architecture experts define freshness policies: Financial data 1 hour, news content 6 hours, product information 1 day, policy documents 1 month.

Automatic freshness control: Timestamp monitoring, automatic removal of expired content, update alerts. Old information never mixes into context.

Result: AI systems use 100% current information, incorrect decision risk is eliminated, information reliability is maximized.

With the Context Architecture profession, time becomes a critical component of context.
