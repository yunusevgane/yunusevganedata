Context Layer in Product Strategy

 I'll explain the importance of the context layer in product strategy.

Traditional product architecture: User interface, business logic, data layer. However, in the AI era, a new layer is needed: Context Layer. This layer is the critical component that manages the product's intelligence.

Context Architecture experts integrate the context layer into the product DNA. User behaviors, system state, and business rules converge in this layer, providing meaningful information to AI.

The context layer enables smart features like personalization, prediction, and automation. The product becomes not just reactive, but proactive.

Result: Products transform from static tools to intelligent assistants. User experience improves by 300%, product value multiplies.

With the Context Architecture profession, product strategy becomes ready for the AI era.
