Fail-Safe Design: Safe Fallback When Context is Missing

 I'll explain fail-safe design.

Context systems can fail. Data source is cut off, API doesn't respond, context becomes empty. In this case, system shouldn't crash, should switch to safe mode.

Context Architecture experts design fail-safe mechanisms: Default context, backup sources, degraded mode operation.

Safe fallback strategies: General response when no context, conservative decision in uncertainty, human routing in error situations.

Backup systems: Cached context, offline fallback, manual override. System continues to work in all situations.

Result: System works uninterrupted, user experience is preserved, reliability is maximized.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI systems achieve resilient architecture.
