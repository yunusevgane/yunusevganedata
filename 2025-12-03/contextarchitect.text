Context Versioning and Change Logs

 I'll explain context versioning and change logs.

If there's Git for code, there should be versioning for context too. Context changes should be tracked, reversible, and have history maintained. Context Architecture provides this systematic approach.

Context Architecture experts establish context versioning systems: Version number for each context change, change description, impact analysis, rollback plan.

Change logs: Who, when, what, why changed? Which system was affected? How did performance change? All changes are recorded in detail.

Versioning benefits: Rollback to previous version when problems occur, different versions for A/B testing, measuring impact of changes, team coordination.

Result: Context changes become controlled, risk is minimized, change management becomes professional.

With the Context Architecture profession, context management meets software development standards.
