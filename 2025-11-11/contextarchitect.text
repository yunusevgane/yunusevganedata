Context Signals for Model Routing

 I'll explain context signals for model routing.

Deciding which model to use in multi-AI model systems is critical. Context Architecture provides intelligent model routing using contextual signals.

Context Architecture experts make optimal model selection by analyzing factors like user intent, data complexity, response time requirements, and security level.

Fast model for simple questions, powerful model for complex analyses, secure model for sensitive data. The most suitable AI model is automatically selected for each situation.

Result: System performance increases by 300%, costs are optimized, user experience is at maximum quality in every situation.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI systems transform into intelligent model orchestrators.
