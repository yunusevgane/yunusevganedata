Auditability: Who Injected What, When?

 I'll explain the auditability system.

Every change in context systems should be traceable. The question "Who, what, when injected?" should always be answerable. Audit trail is critical for security and compliance.

Context Architecture experts establish comprehensive audit systems: User identity, timestamp, change details, impact area are recorded for every context change.

Monitoring scope: Context addition, update, deletion, access, export. All operations are logged in detail, immutable records are created.

Forensic analysis: In security incidents, who changed which context when? Which decisions were made based on this context? Complete traceability.

Result: 100% auditability is ensured, security incidents are resolved, regulatory compliance is guaranteed.

With the Context Architecture profession, context management achieves full audit system.
