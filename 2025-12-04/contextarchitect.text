"Single Source of Context" Principle

 I'll explain the "Single Source of Context" principle.

In multi-system environments, if the same context information is stored in different places, chaos occurs. "Customer X's profile" should not exist in 5 different ways across 5 different systems. Single Source of Context guarantees a single source of truth.

Context Architecture experts design centralized context repositories: All systems feed from the same source, updates are made from a single point, 100% consistency is ensured.

Principle implementation: A single authoritative source is determined for each context type. Other systems reference this source, don't keep their own copies. Changes are only made in the master source.

Synchronization strategy: Real-time API calls, scheduled sync jobs, event-driven updates. All systems always see the same truth.

Result: Context inconsistencies are 100% eliminated, data conflicts end, system reliability is maximized.

With the Context Architecture profession, context management achieves the single source of truth principle.
