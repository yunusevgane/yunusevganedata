Bias and Context: Measure, Monitor, Correct

 I'll explain bias and context management.

AI systems can contain bias. Context can amplify or reduce this bias. Context Architecture measures, monitors, and corrects bias.

Context Architecture experts establish bias detection systems: Demographic unfairness, sectoral prejudice, geographical bias, time-based bias analysis.

Bias correction strategies: Balanced context examples, diversity controls, fair representation, continuous calibration.

Result: Bias decreases by 80%, fair decisions are made, system reliability increases.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI systems transform into fairness experts.
