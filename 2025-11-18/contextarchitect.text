Topic Shift and Context Reset Strategy

 I'll explain topic shift and context reset strategy.

When users change topics, AI systems can get stuck in old context. Saying "I want to buy a car" then asking for "cooking recipe" creates confusion. Context Architecture manages these transitions intelligently.

Context Architecture experts define topic shift signals: Keyword changes, question type differences, context mismatches. When these signals are detected, context clearing strategy activates.

Gradual reset: Gradual context reduction instead of complete clearing. User history is preserved but active context is updated. Smooth transition without breaking user experience.

Result: 80% more accurate responses during topic changes, context confusion eliminated, user experience becomes fluid.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI systems transform into flexible topic management experts.
