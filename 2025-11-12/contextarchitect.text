Shared Context in Multi-Agent Systems

 I'll explain shared context in multi-agent systems.

If each agent works in its own context in multi-agent AI systems, chaos occurs. Context Architecture ensures coordination by creating a shared context pool that all agents share.

Context Architecture experts design information sharing protocols between agents. One agent adds learned information to shared context, other agents benefit from this information.

Example: Sales agent resolved customer objection, support agent used this information to better handle similar future situations. Shared learning transforms individual success into system success.

Result: Inter-agent synergy increases by 400%, system intelligence multiplies, coordination becomes perfect.

With the Context Architecture profession, multi-agent systems work harmoniously like an orchestra.
