Secure Context: PII Masking and Redaction

 I'll explain secure context management.

AI systems must comply with regulations like GDPR, KVKK when processing personal data. PII (Personally Identifiable Information) masking and redaction must be done at context level.

Context Architecture experts establish sensitive data detection and automatic masking systems. Credit card numbers, national ID numbers, email addresses are automatically detected and masked within context.

Dynamic redaction: Different masking levels based on user authorization. Admin sees full information, operator sees partial information, customer sees only themselves.

Result: 100% GDPR compliance, personal data security, legal risk minimization.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI systems transform into secure data processing experts.
