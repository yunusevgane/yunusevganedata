Source Reliability Score: Context Selection Rules

 I'll explain source reliability scoring.

Not all information sources are equal. Official documents are 95% reliable, social media is 30% reliable. Context Architecture assigns reliability scores to each source and uses them in context selection.

Context Architecture experts determine source evaluation criteria: Source authority, data freshness status, verification frequency, historical accuracy rate.

Dynamic score updates: Source performance is continuously monitored, score decreases when providing incorrect information, score increases when providing correct information.

Result: AI systems use 90% more reliable information, incorrect information risk is minimized, user trust increases.

With the Context Architecture profession, information quality is kept under control.
