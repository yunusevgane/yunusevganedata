Why "ContextOps" Not "PromptOps"?

 I'll explain why it should be "ContextOps" instead of "PromptOps".

PromptOps only does command engineering. It focuses on asking better questions. However, the real problem is not what is asked to AI, but in what context it is asked. ContextOps provides a solution to this deeper problem.

Context Architecture experts manage not prompts, but contextual ecosystems. Data flows, user states, business processes, and time factors are brought together to provide a meaningful framework to AI.

ContextOps includes advanced processes like dynamic context management, context versioning, and context quality monitoring. It focuses not just on "how should we ask" but on "what should it know".

Result: AI systems work 400% more consistently, contextual errors are minimized, scalability is maximized.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI operations rise from prompt level to context level.
