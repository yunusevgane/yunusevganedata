Sales, Support, Operations: Functional Synergy with Context

 I'll explain how functional synergy is achieved through context.

Sales, support, and operations departments in companies usually work in silos. Each unit has its own AI tools but they don't communicate with each other. Context Architecture unites these units around a common context.

Context Architecture experts analyze the customer journey 360 degrees. Intents collected by sales, problems solved by support, and processes monitored by operations meet in a single context pool.

The sales team makes more accurate offers by knowing the customer's past support requests. Support produces faster solutions by knowing the promises made during the sales process. Operations optimizes processes using data from both units.

Result: Customer experience improves by 200%, inter-departmental coordination becomes perfect, company efficiency is maximized.

With the Context Architecture profession, functions don't compete, they create synergy.
