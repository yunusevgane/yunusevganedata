Vector Database Selection: When, Why, How?

 I'll explain vector database selection.

"Which vector DB should I use?" is the wrong starting point. The right question is: "What vector DB features does my context strategy require?" Context Architecture makes technical choices based on business requirements.

Context Architecture experts make optimal selection by analyzing data volume, query complexity, freshness requirements, security needs, and cost tolerance.

Chroma for simple prototypes, Pinecone for scaled production, Weaviate for complex relationships. Each scenario requires a different solution.

Result: Technology choice serves business goals, performance is optimized, cost is kept under control.

With the Context Architecture profession, vector DB selection becomes a strategic decision.
