Retrieval Policy Design (Policy-Based RAG)

 I'll explain Retrieval policy design.

RAG systems usually perform simple similarity searches. Policy-based RAG implements intelligent information retrieval strategies by considering business rules and contextual factors.

Context Architecture experts define retrieval policies: Different information levels based on user role, current/historical data balance based on time factor, access filters based on security level.

Example policy: "VIP customer + technical support + emergency = Most detailed technical documents + expert contact information + accelerated process". Special retrieval strategy for each situation.

Result: RAG systems retrieve 400% more accurate information, security breaches are prevented, user experience is optimized.

With the Context Architecture profession, RAG systems transform into intelligent information strategists.
