Data Classification and Context Levels (Public/PII/Confidential)

 I'll explain data classification and context levels.

Not all data is the same. Public information, PII (personal data), confidential information require different security levels. Context Architecture automatically handles this classification.

Context Architecture experts create data sensitivity matrices: Public (everyone accessible), Internal (company-wide), Confidential (authorized personnel), Restricted (top level). Each level has different context rules.

Automatic classification: Data type detection with ML algorithms, sensitivity score calculation, automatic labeling. Data is classified at entry and placed in appropriate context layer.

Result: 100% data security compliance, automatic compliance, risk minimization.

With the Context Architecture profession, data management becomes security-focused.
