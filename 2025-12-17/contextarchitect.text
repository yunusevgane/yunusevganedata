"Context Drift" Detection and Alert Thresholds

 I'll explain "Context drift" detection and alarm thresholds.

Context quality can degrade over time. Old data loses currency, user behaviors change. Context drift silently deteriorates system performance.

Context Architecture experts establish drift detection systems: Context frequency analysis, semantic shift detection, performance change monitoring.

Alarm thresholds: 10% performance drop warning, 20% drop critical alarm, 30% drop automatic intervention.

Corrective actions: Context refresh, model retraining, data updates, calibration adjustments.

Result: Context drift is detected early, system performance stays stable, user experience doesn't deteriorate.

With the Context Architecture profession, AI systems transform into self-improving organisms.
